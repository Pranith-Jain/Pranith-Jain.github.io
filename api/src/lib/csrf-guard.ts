/**
 * CSRF protection via origin / referer header validation.
 *
 * For every mutation request (POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT), checks that the
 * request's `Origin` or `Referer` header matches the canonical origin.
 * This prevents a malicious site from tricking a logged-in operator's
 * browser into issuing a state-changing request (briefing build, admin
 * action, etc.) while they browse another tab.
 *
 * The `X-Admin-Token` header already authenticates mutation endpoints;
 * this middleware adds defence-in-depth against CSRF on top of that.
 *
 * Fail-closed: if the origin cannot be verified, the request is rejected
 * with 403. The only bypass is `Origin` header not being sent AND `Referer`
 * header not being sent, which is extremely rare for browser-initiated
 * mutations (browsers always send `Origin` on cross-origin POST and
 * `Referer` on same-origin mutations).
 *
 * Same-origin policy: for same-origin requests (Origin matches the
 * canonical domain), the request passes. For cross-origin requests
 * (which should never happen for our API since the frontend is on the
 * same domain), the request is rejected. For server-to-server callers
 * (no Origin / Referer headers) the guard passes through.
 *
 * ── Known gap: this guard is NOT an authorization boundary ──────────────
 *
 * Two independent reasons, both current:
 *
 * 1. `authenticate('external-only')` waives the API-key requirement for ANY
 *    same-origin-looking request, including mutations — its `isSameOrigin()`
 *    check runs before any method check. It trusts `Sec-Fetch-Site`,
 *    `Origin`, and `Referer`, all of which any non-browser client can set:
 *
 *      curl -X POST -H 'Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin' \
 *           https://<host>/api/v1/estate/alerts -d '{...}'   # reaches the handler
 *
 *    This is deliberate, not an oversight: the site is prerendered static
 *    HTML with no capability to hold a secret, and ~128 SPA features POST
 *    to /api/v1/* keylessly. Restricting the exemption to GET/HEAD was
 *    evaluated and measured (it passes the auth suite) but breaks those
 *    callers, so it is not applied.
 *
 * 2. Because of (1), the no-Origin/no-Referer passthrough below is reachable
 *    by a plain unauthenticated POST, so the invariant this file previously
 *    claimed — "every mutation endpoint behind this guard also requires
 *    authentication" — does not hold for /api/v1/* routes under
 *    `external-only`. It DOES still hold for `authenticate('required')`
 *    routes (e.g. /api/v1/admin/*) and for MCP, which authenticates in
 *    `DfirMcpServer.onConnect` before any tool runs.
 *
 * Genuine protection therefore comes from: `authenticate('required')` on
 * sensitive routes, rate limiting, and Cloudflare-level controls — not from
 * these headers. Closing this properly needs a real capability (Turnstile or
 * equivalent), not a header check.

  // SECURITY NOTE: this comment previously read "auth (admin token, API key)
  // provides the real protection for non-browser callers". That is accurate
  // only for `authenticate('required')` routes and for MCP. It is NOT accurate
  // for /api/v1/* under `authenticate('external-only')`, whose same-origin
  // exemption also covers mutations and trusts forgeable headers — so this
  // passthrough is reachable with no credential at all. See the "Known gap"
  // section at the top of this file. Kept as-is because removing it would
  // break keyless server-to-server callers; the header check remains useful
  // defence-in-depth against *browser*-initiated cross-site CSRF, which is
  // what this middleware is actually for.
