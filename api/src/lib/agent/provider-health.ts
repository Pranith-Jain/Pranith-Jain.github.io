/**
 * LLM provider health tracking — monitors rate limits, response times, and
 * success rates to route requests intelligently.
 *
 * Stored in a module-level (per-isolate) map, NOT the Cache-API. A Workers
 * isolate keeps module state across invocations in the same colo, so the
 * circuit breaker still works across requests — but with ZERO subrequests.
 *
 * Why this matters: the Cache-API counts against the free-plan limit of 50
 * subrequests per Worker invocation. The old Cache-API-backed implementation
 * did ~3 subrequests per LLM call (isProviderHealthy match + recordSuccess/
 * recordFailure match+put). Across a synthesis + ensemble-QA invocation that
 * churn exhausted the budget and every QA provider call failed with "Too many
 * subrequests by single Worker invocation". In-memory tracking removes that
 * cost entirely while preserving cross-request circuit-breaking.
