/**
 * Regenerate `eslint-rules/raw-colors-baseline.mjs`.
 *
 * Run after landing a batch of `no-raw-colors` fixes:
 *
 *     node scripts/update-raw-colors-baseline.mjs
 *
 * The baseline is the set of files that still trip the rule. Shrinking it is
 * how progress on the token migration becomes visible: after a cleanup commit,
 * this script drops the cleaned files and the rule tightens over them again.
 *
 * The rule is disabled for baselined paths in `eslint.config.js` (so CI's
 * `--max-warnings 0` gate can pass), which means this script has to run the
 * rule explicitly via `--rule` rather than reading the current config.
 *
 * ## Why `--rule` makes this non-circular
 *
 * The obvious worry is that baselined files have the rule off, so a scan cannot
 * see them and stale entries would never drop off the list. That does not
 * apply: `--rule` overrides the flat config, forcing the rule on for EVERY
 * file. Verified directly -- with the config as-is this scan reports 0 files,
 * with `--rule` it reports all of them.
 *
 * So one pass is authoritative, and a listed file that no longer reports
 * anything does drop off. `--check` fails if the committed list disagrees with
 * a fresh scan in either direction: stale entries (suppress nothing) or
 * missing files (would fail CI at `--max-warnings 0`).

 * Legacy raw-palette baseline for the \`no-raw-colors\` ESLint rule.
 *
 * Generated, not hand-maintained. Regenerate with:
 *
 *     node scripts/update-raw-colors-baseline.mjs
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * \`no-raw-colors\` (added in 3d66d0e0c) is correct about what it reports: the
 * rule's own test suite passes. But it also flags ~1,800 pre-existing usages
 * across 203 files, and CI gates on \`--max-warnings 0\`, so enabling it repo-
 * wide fails every push.
 *
 * ## Why a baseline rather than turning the rule off
 *
 * Turning the rule off entirely would also stop it catching NEW raw colours,
 * which is the actual value. This list scopes the waiver to the files that
 * already carry the debt, so the rule stays live everywhere else - including
 * any file added after this baseline was generated.
 *
 * ## Why the residue is not bulk-fixable
 *
 * The rule auto-fixes the cases where the mapping is provably a rename: the
 * light half of the pair exactly equals the token's light value, so nothing
 * moves. Those are applied (\`npm run lint:baseline -- --fix\`, see below) and
 * the list shrinks as files clear.
 *
 * What remains is reported but deliberately NOT auto-fixed, because the
 * rewrite would change rendering rather than spelling:
 *
 *  - \`dark:bg-white/10\` and friends. White at 10% LIFTS a navy card;
 *    \`--surface-100\` is near-black in dark mode, so the token form DARKENS
 *    it. Same class name, opposite effect.
 *  - \`text-white\` with no saturated fill behind it. White on a neutral
 *    surface is a contrast bug; renaming it to a reactive ink would hide that
 *    instead of surfacing it.
 *  - Steps with no token at all (\`slate-950\`, \`border-slate-700\`).
 *
 * Each entry should leave the list as its file is cleaned up.
