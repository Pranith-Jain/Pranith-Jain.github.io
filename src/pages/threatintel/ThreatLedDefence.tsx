/**
 * /threatintel/wiki/threat-led-defence -- Threat Led Defence (BS5055).
 *
 * BS5055:2020 "The cyber security toolkit: principles and guidance for
 * cyber security built around the idea of threat led defence", published by
 * BSI in the UK under the National Cyber Security Centre's Cyber Security
 * Toolkit.
 *
 * ## Why it is here
 *
 * The platform carries the operational frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, Kill Chain,
 * F3EAD, Diamond, OODA) and the governance ones (GRC, TID-CMM, UTIOM). What
 * was missing was BS5055, which is different in kind: it is a *certifiable*
 * cyber-resilience standard with a fixed three-principle spine and a five-pillar
 * defence model. TID-CMM and UTIOM ask how mature your capability is; BS5055
 * asks whether you can evidence that your controls were chosen against
 * threats and then validated against them.
 *
 * Everything here is written to be actionable on this platform rather than to
 * be a summary of the standard: each pillar names the surfaces in this
 * codebase that already produce the artefacts an assessor would ask for.
 *
 * Static, no backend roundtrip. Follows the pattern of F3EAD.tsx, Ooda.tsx and
 * the other framework pages in the wiki catalog group.

          <p className="text-sm text-muted leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
            BS5055 is a UK standard for building cyber security around threat led defence rather than around compliance.
            It has three principles and a five-pillar defence model. What separates it from most frameworks on this page
            is that it is <span className="text-body font-medium">certifiable</span>: an independent assessor asks for
            evidence that your controls were chosen against threats and then tested against them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mt-2">
            Each pillar below names the surfaces in this platform that already produce the artefacts an assessor would
            ask for. The standard is mapped onto what you can already do rather than described in the abstract.
