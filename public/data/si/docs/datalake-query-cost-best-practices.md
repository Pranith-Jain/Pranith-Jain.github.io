# Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake — Query Cost Best Practices

**Why this matters:** Data Lake interactive queries are billed on **data scanned** (≈ $5/TB). A 3‑month query over large firewall logs that scans the full table can read tens of terabytes (e.g., 80 TB ≈ $400) even when only a few GB actually match. The goal is to make the engine **read less**, not just return less.

> **The cost model in one line:** billed scan ≈ **(width of the columns actually read) × (rows in the time‑pruned range)**. The engine uses columnar pushdown, so `count` and `summarize by <small column>` stay cheap even over months — the explosions come from **reading wide columns (raw payloads/JSON) across a wide range**, not from row count alone.

---

## ⭐ Rule #0 — Estimate before you run

Never launch a wide historical scan blind. The `Usage` table is tiny and free to query — preview how much you're about to scan first.

```kql
// ---- Data Lake scan-volume + cost estimator ----
// Set these three values:
let TableName = "AWSCloudTrail";          // table you intend to query
let StartDate = datetime(2026-03-01);     // inclusive
let EndDate   = datetime(2026-06-01);     // exclusive
let RatePerTB = 5.0;                       // your Data Lake $/TB scanned
// -------------------------------------------------
let Weekly = Usage
    | where TimeGenerated >= StartDate and TimeGenerated < EndDate
    | where DataType == TableName
    | summarize GB = sum(Quantity) / 1024.0
        by Period = format_datetime(startofweek(TimeGenerated), "yyyy-MM-dd");
Weekly
| union (Weekly | summarize GB = sum(GB) | extend Period = "TOTAL")
| extend GB = round(GB, 3)
| extend EstScannedTB = round(GB / 1024.0, 3)
| extend EstCostUSD   = round((GB / 1024.0) * RatePerTB, 2)
| order by Period asc
```

Output: a weekly ingest breakdown for the table plus a `TOTAL` row, with estimated TB scanned and $ cost for the date range.

> **Note:** `Usage.Quantity` is ingested/billed volume (MB) — an excellent ballpark for scan volume, but not a penny‑exact invoice match. `startofweek()` is Sunday‑based, so the first/last buckets may be partial weeks.

> ⚠️ **Retention prerequisite — extend `Usage` retention for long-range estimates.** `Usage` is a standard Analytics-tier table that defaults to the workspace interactive retention (typically 90 days). If your `StartDate` reaches further back than that, the estimator **silently under-reports** — you just get fewer weekly rows, with no error. To make the estimator work over arbitrary windows:
>
> - **Raise the `Usage` table's _total_ (long-term) retention** to your longest reporting horizon — up to 12 years (4,383 days). You do **not** need to extend _interactive_ retention; long-term retention is enough and far cheaper.
> - **The cost is negligible.** `Usage` is a tiny metering table (a few rows per `DataType` per day), so extending its retention adds essentially nothing to storage spend — unlike extending retention on a real telemetry table.
> - **Minor caveat:** once the query reaches _beyond_ the interactive window, that portion is served from long-term retention (a search/Lake-tier read), so the estimator goes from strictly-free to a tiny billed scan. Because `Usage` is so small, it stays effectively free.
> - **Authoritative spend** over long windows still comes from **Azure Cost Management / billing export** (longer retention, source of truth). Use this estimator for _volume/trend projection_; reconcile actual dollars against Cost Management.

## The best practices (ordered by cost impact)

### 1. Don't return raw wide rows — `project` narrow columns or `summarize`

**This is the #1 cost driver.** A query that ends in a bare filter (or exports raw rows) materializes _every column_, including the fat firewall payload/message/JSON columns, for every matching row. Cut to the few columns you need **before** the end of the query, or aggregate.

```kql
// EXPENSIVE — reads every column, including wide payloads
FirewallLogs
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-03-01) .. datetime(2026-06-01))
| where DeviceAction == "deny"

// CHEAP — reads only 5 narrow columns
FirewallLogs
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-03-01) .. datetime(2026-06-01))
| where DeviceAction == "deny"
| project TimeGenerated, SourceIP, DestinationIP, DestinationPort, RuleName
```

**Red flags:** no `project` and no `summarize`; `project *`; selecting the raw payload/JSON column across the full range.

### 2. Put the time filter FIRST — and make it `TimeGenerated`

Data Lake prunes by ingestion‑time partitions. If `TimeGenerated` isn't the very first `where`, pruning silently breaks and you scan the whole table.

```kql
FirewallLogs
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-03-01) .. datetime(2026-06-01))   // FIRST
| where DeviceAction == "deny"
| ...
```

**Pruning killers:** `search *`, `union *`, or any `parse`/`extend`/`project`/`join` placed _before_ the time filter. Also confirm the range bounds are intentional (a missing upper bound or `ago(90d)` typo silently widens the scan).

### 3. Parse / `extend` / `mv-expand` wide columns _after_ the filter, never before

`parse_json` / `parse` / `extract` / `mv-expand` on a wide column **before** the row count is narrowed forces the engine to read that entire wide column for every row in range — this is the classic 80 TB pattern. Always filter rows down first, then parse.

### 4. Narrow the time range to what you actually need

Wide‑open ranges scan more rows. If you don't need all 3 months at once, **chunk it** (e.g., 4 × ~3 weeks) so you can stop early once you find what you need.

### 5. Add selective filters right after the time filter

Filter on the most selective columns next (action, port, source/dest IP, rule name) so the engine skips data blocks early.

### 6. Summarize for trends instead of exporting raw rows

If the goal is counts/patterns, `summarize` / `top` / `percentile` rather than returning millions of raw events. Aggregations are cheap — testing showed a 30‑day `summarize` scanned barely more than a 1‑day one despite 28× the rows.

```kql
FirewallLogs
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2026-03-01) .. datetime(2026-06-01))
| where DeviceAction == "deny"
| summarize Hits = count() by DestinationPort, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| top 20 by Hits
```

### 7. Avoid large‑to‑large joins over months

A `join` between two big lake tables over a wide range multiplies the columns read on both sides. Filter and `project` both sides first, or `lookup` against a small set.

### 8. Prefer `has` / `==` over `contains` / regex — for _speed_, not bytes

`contains`, `matches regex`, and `has_cs` on free text force full‑text matching. **Note:** in testing this did **not** reduce bytes‑scanned versus `has` (the column is read either way) — the win is CPU and latency, plus correctness. Fix it, but it is **not** the lever that causes a runaway _cost_; columns 1–3 are.

### 9. For recurring big‑history needs, use KQL Jobs — don't re‑scan interactively

Run the expensive scan **once** as a scheduled Data Lake job that writes a curated/summarized output (e.g., to the Analytics tier), then query that small result repeatedly. Aggregating noisy traffic (allows, health checks) at this stage cuts both scan and storage cost.

## Quick checklist before running any large Data Lake query

- [ ] Ran the **Usage estimator** and confirmed the projected TB/$ is acceptable
- [ ] Query **`summarize`s or `project`s to narrow columns** — no bare raw‑row output, no `project *`, no wide payload/JSON column pulled across the range
- [ ] `where TimeGenerated between(...)` is the **first** line; range bounds are intentional
- [ ] No `parse`/`parse_json`/`extend`/`mv-expand` on a wide column **before** the row filter
- [ ] Most selective filters come next; `has`/`==` used (no `contains`/regex)
- [ ] No large‑to‑large `join` over the full range
- [ ] Output is **aggregated** (or chunked) rather than a raw bulk export
- [ ] Recurring/historical workloads moved to a **KQL Job + curated output**

## Who is querying the Lake? (all sources, not just MCP)

To find **every** user/identity running Data Lake queries — and spot who is driving cost — query the Purview unified audit surfaced in `CloudAppEvents`. This captures **all** Lake query channels, not just the MCP server: the Portal Data Lake Explorer, scheduled jobs, Security Copilot, Workbooks, Jupyter, Power BI, and direct KQL.

```kql
// ---- All identities querying the Sentinel Data Lake (last 30d) ----
let lookback = 30d;
// Resolve UserId GUIDs -> UPNs (best-effort; portal/job service identities won't resolve)
let upnMap = SigninLogs
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback)
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName) by UserId
    | project UserId, UserPrincipalName;
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback)
| where ActionType contains "Sentinel" or ActionType contains "KQL"   // CamelCase: use contains, NOT has
| extend RawData = parse_json(tostring(RawEventData))
| extend
    Operation     = tostring(RawData.Operation),
    RecordType    = toint(RawData.RecordType),
    Interface     = tostring(RawData.Interface),
    FailureReason = tostring(RawData.FailureReason),
    ExecDuration  = todouble(RawData.ExecutionDuration),
    TablesRead    = tostring(RawData.TablesRead),
    UserId        = tostring(RawData.UserId)
| where Operation contains "Completed" or RecordType == 379
| extend QuerySource = case(
    RecordType == 403 and Interface == "IMcpToolTemplate",  "MCP (stdio)",
    RecordType == 403 and Interface == "HttpMcpToolTemplate","MCP (HTTP)",
    RecordType == 379 and (Interface == "InterfaceNotProvided" or isempty(Interface)), "MCP-Driven (Probable)",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "msglakeexplorer",  "Portal (Lake Explorer)",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "msgjobmanagement",  "Scheduled Jobs",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "Medeina",           "Security Copilot",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "workbook",          "Workbook/Dashboard",
    RecordType == 379, strcat("Direct KQL (", Interface, ")"),
    "Other")
| summarize
    LakeQueries    = count(),
    Failures       = countif(isnotempty(FailureReason)),
    AvgDurationSec = round(avg(ExecDuration), 2),
    MaxDurationSec = round(max(ExecDuration), 2),
    Sources        = make_set(QuerySource, 10),
    TopTables      = make_set(TablesRead, 25),
    LastSeen       = max(TimeGenerated)
    by UserId
| join kind=leftouter upnMap on UserId
| extend Account = coalesce(UserPrincipalName, UserId)
| project Account, LakeQueries, Failures, AvgDurationSec, MaxDurationSec, Sources, LastSeen
| order by LakeQueries desc
```

**Notes & pitfalls (field-verified):**

- **`contains`, not `has`** — Sentinel audit values (`SentinelAIToolRunCompleted`, `KQLQueryCompleted`) are CamelCase with no word boundaries, so `has "Completed"` returns **false** for all of them and silently drops MCP rows.
- **`RawEventData` is a JSON string** — wrap in `parse_json(tostring(...))` and parse **once**.
- **Query channels you'll see** (`Sources` column): `MCP (stdio)` / `MCP (HTTP)` = the Sentinel Data Lake MCP server; `MCP-Driven (Probable)` = RecordType 379 with `InterfaceNotProvided` (MCP queries the audit pipeline didn't tag as 403); `Portal (Lake Explorer)` = `msglakeexplorer@msec-msg`; `Scheduled Jobs` = `msgjobmanagement@msec-msg`; plus Security Copilot, Workbooks, Jupyter (`ipykernel_launcher.py`), Power BI (`PowerBIConnector`).
- **UPN resolution is best-effort** — interactive users resolve via `SigninLogs`; service/portal identities (jobs, dashboards) keep their GUID/interface name in `Account`.
- **Want a per-source rollup instead of per-user?** Swap the `summarize ... by UserId` to `by QuerySource` for a channel-level breakdown, or add `bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)` for a daily trend.
- **Cost caveat:** this shows **who runs queries and how often/how long** — it is _activity_, not billed scan. `AvgDurationSec`/`MaxDurationSec` is the best in-table proxy for "expensive" queries; pair the heavy users with the Azure cost meter for the authoritative spend.

## Want the actual query text too?

The same `CloudAppEvents` records carry the **full KQL body**, so you can see exactly _what_ each user ran — invaluable for spotting the expensive anti-patterns (`search *`, `union withsource=* *`, wide-column scans) and coaching the people running them.

The query text lives in different fields depending on the channel:

- **Direct KQL (RecordType 379)** — `RawEventData.QueryText` holds the raw KQL (Portal Lake Explorer, Scheduled Jobs, Security Copilot, and probable-MCP all populate it).
- **MCP tool calls (RecordType 403)** — the tool argument is in `RawEventData.InputParameters` as `{"query": "..."}`. For `query_lake` this is the KQL; for other tools it's that tool's input.

```kql
// ---- Actual KQL text per Lake query, heaviest first (last 7d) ----
let lookback = 7d;
let upnMap = SigninLogs
    | where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName) by UserId
    | project UserId, UserPrincipalName;
CloudAppEvents
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(lookback)
| where ActionType contains "Sentinel" or ActionType contains "KQL"
| extend RawData = parse_json(tostring(RawEventData))
| extend
    Operation      = tostring(RawData.Operation),
    RecordType     = toint(RawData.RecordType),
    Interface      = tostring(RawData.Interface),
    ToolName       = tostring(RawData.ToolName),
    FailureReason  = tostring(RawData.FailureReason),
    ExecDurationMs = todouble(RawData.ExecutionDuration),
    TablesRead     = tostring(RawData.TablesRead),
    UserId         = tostring(RawData.UserId),
    QueryText      = tostring(RawData.QueryText),
    InputParams    = tostring(RawData.InputParameters)
| where Operation contains "Completed" or RecordType == 379
| extend QuerySource = case(
    RecordType == 403 and Interface == "IMcpToolTemplate",  "MCP (stdio)",
    RecordType == 403 and Interface == "HttpMcpToolTemplate","MCP (HTTP)",
    RecordType == 379 and (Interface == "InterfaceNotProvided" or isempty(Interface)), "MCP-Driven (Probable)",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "msglakeexplorer",  "Portal (Lake Explorer)",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "msgjobmanagement",  "Scheduled Jobs",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "Medeina",           "Security Copilot",
    RecordType == 379 and Interface has "workbook",          "Workbook/Dashboard",
    RecordType == 379, strcat("Direct KQL (", Interface, ")"),
    "Other")
// 379 -> QueryText; 403 -> InputParameters.query (the tool argument)
| extend QueryContent = iff(RecordType == 379, QueryText, tostring(parse_json(InputParams).query))
| where isnotempty(QueryContent)
| join kind=leftouter upnMap on UserId
| extend Account = coalesce(UserPrincipalName, ToolName, UserId)  // ToolName fills in for unresolved MCP identities
| project TimeGenerated, Account, QuerySource, ExecDurationMs, Tables = TablesRead,
    Failed = isnotempty(FailureReason),
    QueryContent = substring(QueryContent, 0, 500)   // trim; remove to see full text
| order by ExecDurationMs desc
| take 50
```

**Notes:**

- **Anti-pattern hunting:** sort by `ExecDurationMs` (it's **milliseconds**, despite some UIs labeling seconds) and scan the `QueryContent` for the runaway shapes from this guide — `search *`, `union withsource=* *`, no leading `TimeGenerated` filter, or a wide payload column pulled across a long range. In practice these dominate the top of the list.
- **`QueryContent` is trimmed to 500 chars** with `substring()` to keep the result readable — drop that line to capture the full query body (some are 2,000+ chars).
- **Privacy note:** query bodies can embed indicators an analyst was hunting (domains, IPs, UPNs). Treat this output as sensitive and restrict who can run it.
- **Per-user rollup of distinct queries:** swap the tail for `| summarize Queries = dcount(QueryContent), Samples = make_set(substring(QueryContent,0,200), 10), MaxDurationMs = max(ExecDurationMs) by Account | order by MaxDurationMs desc`.

## Appendix — Reading per‑query scan stats (and their limits)

Each Data Lake query result carries a `QueryResourceConsumption` block you can inspect to understand a query's footprint:

| Field                                                                   | Meaning                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `input_dataset_statistics.extents.scanned`                              | data shards (extents) read              |
| `input_dataset_statistics.rows.scanned`                                 | rows read                               |
| `external_data.downloaded_bytes` / `downloaded_items`                   | lake (parquet) artifacts + bytes pulled |
| `resource_usage.cpu.total cpu`, `memory.peak_per_node`, `ExecutionTime` | compute cost                            |

**Important caveats (validated by testing on `AWSCloudTrail`):**

- These stats reflect the **query engine's orchestration over the columnar store**, heavily optimized by pushdown. `downloaded_bytes` did **not** scale with rows (28× rows → 1.46× bytes) and did **not** change between `contains` and `has`.
- Therefore **do not treat `downloaded_bytes` as the billed‑scan meter** — it under‑represents and doesn't track row‑level filters.
- Use the **`Usage`‑table estimator (Rule #0)** for the cost ballpark, and confirm the authoritative billed figure in **Azure cost meters**, not from this block.
