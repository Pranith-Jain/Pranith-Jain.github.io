**346 tools** | live at `https://pranithjain.qzz.io/api/mcp` (streamable HTTP).

## Quick start

1. Generate an API key at `/api/v1/admin/keys` (admin token required).
2. Drop one of the config snippets in this directory into your MCP client config:
   - **Claude Desktop**: `claude-desktop.json` -> `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows).
   - **Cursor**: `cursor.json` -> `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.
   - **VS Code (Copilot)**: `vscode-mcp.json` -> `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace.
3. Replace `<your-api-key>` with a real key.
4. Restart your client. Tools appear as `mcp__dfir-threatintel__<tool_name>`.
