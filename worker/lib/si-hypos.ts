/**
 * HYPOS — Hypothesis engine for threat hunting.
 *
 * Edge-native hypothesis generator replicated from
 * https://h3ad-sec.github.io/HYPOS/ — "Hunt smarter. Miss nothing."
 *
 * Given an observed anomaly (free-text description of an alert, a
 * noisy metric, a suspicious host, or a cluster of IOCs), HYPOS
 * returns:
 *   - ranked hypotheses (each: title, narrative, what-to-look-for,
 *     kill-chain phase, MITRE techniques, evidence signals, expected
 *     false-positive scenarios, sample KQL)
 *   - the SI skills (from our /public/data/si/skills/ corpus) that
 *     best match the anomaly, so the LLM client can pull them with
 *     `si_get_skill` and follow the analyst playbook
 *
 * The hypothesis catalogue is hand-curated from the platform's
 * common SOC scenarios. The retrieval layer scores free-text
 * observations against each hypothesis via simple token overlap +
 * keyword weighting, then surfaces the top N with a confidence %.
 *
 * Exposed as:
 *   - MCP tool `si_hypos_generate`  (Worker)
 *   - REST  `POST /api/v1/si/hypos`  (api)
 *
 * No external API calls — pure scorer + corpus. Edge-native.
